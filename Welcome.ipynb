    "iguazio data platform enables fast delivery of intelligent real-time and event driven applications, and is comprised of the following layers:\n",
    "* User development and access services: nuclio real-time serverless functions, Jupyter notebooks and Real-time dashboards (based on Grafana)\n",
    "* Data and api services: host pre-integrated services such as Spark, Presto, Web APIs, etc. \n",
    "* high-performance unified database: allow simultanious access through multiple standard/open APIs and data models(file, object, SQL, NoSQL, stream, time-series). \n",
    "\n",
    "Iguazio platform is a fully managed PaaS over Kubernetes with security, user management, logging and monitoring. <br>\n",
    "It can be deployed in the public cloud, on-prem datacenter, or be delivered as an Edge appliance.  "
